# vimrc
This project keeps my .vimrc and related files.

This is based on a solarized configuration and works best if term, command
prompt etc is setup that way as well.  See http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized


A couple of notable notes:

* <leader> is ,
* Use backslash \ for history
* Use pipe | for yankring (uber paste)
