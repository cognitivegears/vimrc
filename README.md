# vimrc
This project keeps my .vimrc and related files.

This is based on a solarized configuration and works best if term, command
prompt etc is setup that way as well.  See http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

Works best with the Hack font (can use other solarized fonts as well):
https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/Hack

This uses powerline, installation instructions:
Linux: http://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation/linux.html
Mac: http://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation/osx.html

Also will need a VIM compiled with python support:
vim --version|grep python



A couple of notable notes:

* <leader> is ,
* Use backslash \ for history
* Use pipe | for yankring (uber paste)
